- Get notified if you've selected conflicting classes before making changes in HokieSPA
- Check section availability
- Compare professor reviews and access HokieSpa to change courses in-app

Requirements:
- Windows Vista or greater, macOS/OSX, Linux
- Java 8u40 or greater. (Oracle JRE/JDK only. OpenJDK is unsupported.)

You can get the latest version of Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/).
